# When Certbot detects that a certificate is due for renewal, --pre-hook and --post-hook hooks run before and after each attempt to renew it. If you want your hook to run only after a successful renewal, use --deploy-hook in a command like this. You can also specify hooks by placing files in subdirectories of Certbotâ€™s configuration directory.

# Restart Nginx after successful cert renewal
sudo systemctl restart nginx
